Notes

add tests!
create an Apple object
remove color from Coord and move to snake and apple
add event listener to level: notify user when level up

make it 2 player
bug: player 2 hits a direction twice its removed from input queue
rewrite the game in coffeeScript!


add a second player.

Add colors
  the head should always be the same color... the color the snake is going for
  new apples must then be added to the second segment... or keep the head as a different segment altogether

When two snakes bump heads, reverse the direction of the snake and move head to the end of the snake... a good defensive manuever if your about to be eaten

The view can't simply redraw the board every turn, there are just too many divs to be rendered every 1/3 of a second


The snake object cant reference the game object
Game -> Snake -> Board -> Coord

Object - Apple
  label: A
  Color: random
  type: apple

Object - Snake
  label: S, T, or H
  Color: appleColor || teamColor 
  type: snake, Tail, Head
