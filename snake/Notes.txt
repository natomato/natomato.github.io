Notes


rewrite the game in coffeeScript!

add pause feature

Currently the board does not know where the snake is:
  For two player snake, the board must mark the tiles of the snake

Add colors
  the head should always be the same color... the color the snake is going for
  new apples must then be added to the second segment... or keep the head as a different segment altogether

When two snakes bump heads, reverse the direction of the snake and move head to the end of the snake... a good defensive manuever if your about to be eaten

The view can't simply redraw the board every turn, there are just too many divs to be rendered every 1/3 of a second


The snake object cant reference the game object
Game -> Snake -> Board -> Coord

2 + 1 = 3
3 + 3 = 6   ..maintain 3 ( 6 + 2)
8 + 5 = 13  ..maintain 5 (13 + 4)
17+ 7 = 24

outer counter
  max level
